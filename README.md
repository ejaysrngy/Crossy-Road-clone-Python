# Crossy-Road-clone-Python

A 100 Days of Code project
This game is based off a popular mobile game wherein you simply have to take your animal, in this case, a turtle, on the other side of the road. <br />
This project was done independently without taking any hints from the bootcamp as I wanted to challenge myself to be proficient in Python. <br />

You control the turtle by using the WASD keys
The "cars" spawn at the right side of the screen, in their own lanes, they spawn randomly; in varying lengths and speed.
As you progress through the levels, the cars get faster.
